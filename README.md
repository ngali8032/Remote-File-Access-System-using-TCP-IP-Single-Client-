📁 Remote File Access System using TCP/IP (Single Client)

📌 Project Overview

This project implements a single-client TCP/IP based client–server application in C on Linux that enables remote directory navigation and file content retrieval.

The system demonstrates practical implementation of:

- TCP/IP Socket Programming

- Linux System Calls

- File System Navigation

- Permission Handling

- Command-Based Client Interaction

- Connection Management

🏗 System Architecture

🔹 Server

- The server starts first and waits for incoming client connections.

- It binds to a specific IP address and port number.

- Using socket(), bind(), listen(), and accept(), the server establishes a TCP connection.

- Once a client connects successfully, the server begins processing commands.

🔹 Client

The client connects using the server’s IP address and port number.

TCP connection is established using the standard three-way handshake mechanism:

SYN

SYN-ACK

ACK

After successful connection establishment, an interactive command window is displayed for the user.


💻 Working Flow

The server waits for a client to connect.

The client connects using the correct IP address and port number.

After a successful TCP connection, a command interface is opened.

Navigation begins from the root directory using:

cd /

When the client enters a command:

- The command is sent to the server.

- The server processes the request.

- The server fetches directory or file data.

- The response is sent back to the client.

- The client displays the received output.

The client can:

Change directories using cd <directory_name>

Open and read files using:

open <filename>

The server continues sending file content until reading is complete.

If the user types:

help

A guide is displayed showing all supported commands.

If the user types:

exit

or

quit

The connection is gracefully terminated.

🔄 Connection Handling & Error Management


🔹 Server-Side Technical Issues

- If the server encounters any technical issue such as:

Unexpected crash

Manual termination

Network interruption

The TCP connection will break automatically.

In such cases, the client detects the disconnection and displays:

Server got disconnected.
Connection terminated unexpectedly.

This ensures:

Proper user notification

Graceful error handling

Safe resource cleanup

No undefined behavior

📜 Supported Commands

- cd / → Move to root directory

- cd <directory_name> → Change directory
  
- ls → List directories and files
  
- open <filename> → Read file content

- help → Display command guide

- exit / quit → Terminate connection

🛠 Technologies Used

-C Programming

-Linux Operating System

-TCP/IP Socket Programming

-Linux System Calls 

-Permission and Error Management

🎯 Learning Outcomes

- Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- TCP/IP communication and connection establishment

- Linux file system structure

- Client–server architecture design

- System-level debugging

- Handling connection failures and runtime errors

- Resource management and graceful termination


▶️ Compilation & Execution
Compile:
- gcc server.c root.c -o server
- gcc client.c -o client

Run:

Start the server first:

./server <PORTNO>
Then start the client:

./client <PORTNO> <SERVER_IP_ADDRESS>
After connection is establishing successfully the client and server are involved in communication...
